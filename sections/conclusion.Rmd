# Import scripts

We can use the following command to import an r script: 

```{r 'import-ex', echo=TRUE}
library("knitr")
read_chunk('../includes/scripts/test.R')
```

Notice that the `read_chunk()` command takes **this** file as the reference for specifying the path (this is different with regard to inserting graphics). 

# Call chunks

We can directly call knitr chunks from the `test.R` script. 
First let's load the libraries we will need.

```{r, 'libs', echo=TRUE}
```

Now we will generate some data.

```{r, 'data', echo=TRUE}
```

Let's fit a model. 

```{r, 'fit', echo=TRUE}
```

What is the phoneme boundary?

```{r, 'cross', echo=TRUE}
```

It looks like the boundary is at `r as.numeric(coef(glm)[1] / (coef(glm)[2] * -1))`. 
Good. 
Let's plot it to see what it looks like:

```{r, 'plot', echo=TRUE, fig.cap='This is the caption', fig.subcap='Not sure'}
```
